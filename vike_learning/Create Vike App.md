### You have 2 choice :
1. create app with Vike extension
2. create app without Vike extension
## Vike extension !
1. Vike extension integrate tools and you don't have to integrate tools manually
2. Vike has difference extension and now we use Vike react but you can create Vike with Vue and solid and see commands of other extension in [Bati](https://batijs.dev/)
```sh 
pnpm create @batijs/app --react

1. In Vike this way you should integrate tools manually and have more control over project 
2. warning -> if you are expert choose this way
3. create by blow command ->
